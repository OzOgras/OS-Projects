I write a program called runscan that takes two arguments, an input file that contains the disk image and an output directory where your output files will be stored. This program, 

reconstructs all jpg files (both undeleted and deleted ones) from a given disk image. To do this, I scan all inodes that represent regular files and check if the first data block of the inode contains the jpg magic numbers: FF D8 FF E0 or FF D8 FF E1 or FF D8 FF E8.
Once an inode that represents a jpg file is identified, the content of that file is copied to an output file (stored in 'output/' directory), using the inode number as the file name.
